The reason: Irrational fears and politicians eager to show toughness in protecting constituents led to needless quarantines on doctors, nurses and other workers, even when they had no symptoms of the disease and no chance of infecting others.The Ebola virus does not spread easily. To become infected, a person has to come into direct contact with the bodily fluids of a highly infectious individual or a newly dead corpse, as during African burial ceremonies. Infected patients do not transmit the virus until after symptoms appear, so there is no need to confine them before then. Even so, governors in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and other states ratcheted up the panic by imposing mandatory or virtually mandatory quarantines on people they thought were potentially exposed in West Africa.
