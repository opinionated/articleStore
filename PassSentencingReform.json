{"Title":"Pass Sentencing Reform","Link":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/opinion/pass-sentencing-reform.html?partner=rssnyt\u0026emc=rss","Description":"The African American Mayors Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives call on Congress to act.","Data":"To the Editor:It’s time for Congress to stop dragging its feet and pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015(“ Holding Sentencing Reform Hostage,” editorial, Feb. 7).This legislation was developed through thoughtful and deliberate bipartisan compromise, and after all of the effort that has gone into finding this important and rare common ground, it would be foolish to let this chance at significant criminal justice reform go to waste. Our corrections system is in dire need of correcting.The voice of fearmongers must not be allowed to silence the public’s cry for a truly just justice system. Partisan position-taking, like the addition of a “mens rea” (guilty mind) provision, must not be allowed to edge out hard-won common ground.Our cities and communities are tired of waiting for meaningful progress like this bill offers. We need to be tough on crime but also smart on crime. We need sentencing that makes sense and rehabilitation programs that prepare ex-offenders to benefit society rather than burden it.We need Congress to avoid getting bogged down in partisan politics and pass this important legislation now.STEVE BENJAMINGREGORY A. THOMASColumbia, S.C.Mr. Benjamin is mayor of Columbia, S.C., and president of the African American Mayors Association."}
